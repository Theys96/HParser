HParser -- Known Issues

- There is no recognition of erratic grammars. Left recursion will result in stack overflow, grammars that are 
  otherwise not LL(1) will probably produce incompilable parsers, etc.

- Symbols, specifically Terminals have a name defined as a string. In the resulting parser, they are represented as characters.
  Therefore, it is possibly to have a Terminal "num" in the generator, but this will generate to a token 'num', which will
  result in an error, of course.
